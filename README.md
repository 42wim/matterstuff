# mattertee #

[mattertee](https://github.com/42wim/matterstuff/tree/master/mattertee) works like [tee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command)) command (and inspired by [slacktee](https://github.com/course-hero/slacktee)
Instead of writing the standard input to files, *mattertee* posts it to your mattermost installation
